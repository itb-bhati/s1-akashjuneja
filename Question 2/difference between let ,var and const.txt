var is not dead. var can still be used in ES6. Use of var may be good or bad
depending on the situation. let and const is block scoped. We can’t use it
outside the block in which it is defined. So, we should decide between
these by following points:
i) var should be used for variables that are used across various
scopes.
ii) let should be used where we want the variable to have a local
block scope and where we know that the variable may be re-
assigned.
iii) const should be used for block scoped variables whose values
should not change in the entire program, i.e. they should not be
re-assigned.


and by the way
var is functional scope
let and const are functional scope
