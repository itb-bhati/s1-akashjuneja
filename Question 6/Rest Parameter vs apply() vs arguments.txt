6)	Rest Parameter: Through rest parameter, we can accept any number of arguments as an array. Rest parameters are array and all the methods applicable on arrays are applicable on rest parameters too.

apply(): apply() method calls a function where arguments are always provided as single array. Thus, apply() is used to make a function call, unlike the rest parameters which accept arguments in a function.

arguments: arguments is an object that is used inside functions to access the arguments passed to the function. It is different from rest parameters in a way that it is not an array. However, arguments do have a length property.
