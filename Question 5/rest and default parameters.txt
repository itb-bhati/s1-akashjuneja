Arguments object used to contain all the arguments that were passed to
the function. They were mostly used when we didn’t know as to how many
arguments will be passed to the function. However, arguments was not an
array and most of the functions like sort, map, and iterators like forEach
could not be applied to it. However, rest parameters are array and we can
use such functions for these, which makes our work easier.
Also, giving default values to arguments reduce our code compared to using
arguments for assigning the default values.
